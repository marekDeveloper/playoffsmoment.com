# Steps to create website - Resulta info

## 1. Get Drupal 8 core

Download latest Drupal 8 version `8.9.13` into `src` folder using composer

`composer create-project drupal/recommended-project:8.9.13 src`


## 2. Install default D8 site

When going to website URL default installation script `/core/install.php` provides basic/standard D8 installation steps.


## 3. Tweaks for .gitignore

Drupal provides default `example.gitignore` file. Rename that file to `.gitignore` in `src` folder.


## 4. Feeds modules installation

I was thinking using D8 Migrations, that would require creation custom migration yml file. 
I'm wondering if I can do this exercise without writing single line of PHP code. We'll see.

I have decides to use Feeds module where all mapping will be done using Admin UI. 
Feeds module is around for a really long time and was "go to solution" for D7 sites.

Only disadvantage for D8 is "This project is not covered by Drupalâ€™s security advisory policy."
And it does not have stable release, only alpha. But there are plenty if D8 modules in this state.
Plenty of sites are using feeds and there is even D9 work done. 

[https://www.drupal.org/project/feeds]

And we need another module for JSON parsing: [https://www.drupal.org/project/feeds_ex]

Download 2 modules using composer from within `src` directory:

composer require drupal/feeds
composer require drupal/feeds_ex

Go to Admin -> Extend (/admin/modules) and enable 2 new modules.


## 5. Taxonomies

Need to create taxonomies for Conference & Division.

I think I just need to create taxonomy vocabularies and Feeds can create items into lists, we'll see.

Creating 2 vocabularies "NFL Conference" & "NFL Division" - /admin/structure/taxonomy
Created both and empty list of terms for now


## 6. Team content type

Creating new `Team` content type with multiple fields.

Create Team: "Admin -> Structure -> Content types -> Add content type" (/admin/structure/types/add)

Type name: Team.

Tweaks for default form: Remove check for "Promoted to front page" & "Display author and date information" + Disable for Menu

Continue to add new fields in Manage fields section for Team content type + match API fields

name = Title (text plain field) - required
nickname = Nickname (text plain field) - required
display_name = Display Name (text plain field)
conference = Conference (taxonomy reference: NFL Conference)
division = Division (taxonomy reference: NFL Division)
id = API ID (text plain field - integer) - required

For taxonomies reference ... check "Create referenced entities if they don't already exist"

I did some small tweaks in "Manage form display" and "Manage display" tabs.


## 7. Create Feed Type

Need to create new `Feed Type`, go to "Admin -> Structure -> Feed types -> Add feed type".

Type Name: NFL JSON
Description: 3rd party API for NFL team import from JSON
Fetcher: Download from URL
Parser: JsonPath
Processor: Node
Content Type: Team
Import period: 15 minutes
TO DO! Requires cron to be configured?!

Processor settings: Update existing content items & un-publish content item when no longer in the feed + Owner: Feed author

### Feeds Mapping Tab

Context: $.results.data.team.*

id: 			API ID (field_api_id) - unique
name: 			Title (title)
nickname: 		Nickname (field_nickname)
display_name: 	Display Name (field_display_name)
conference: 	Conference (field_conference) - Reference by: Name + Autocreate terms: Yes
division: 		Division (field_division) - Reference by: Name + Autocreate terms: Yes


## 8. Create Feed Node

Go to "Admin -> Content -> Feeds -> Add feed"

Creating new feed 

Title: NFL Teams Import - Resulta Test
Feed URL: 3rd party JSON API provided by Resulta team

Save and run import ... 

And all seems to be working fine ... nice green message "NFL Teams Import - Resulta Test: Created 32 Team items."

Now need to check actual data in D8 CMS.

Information imported into `Team`content type seems all good, even taxonomies are imported properly.


 








## 10000. Teams Page content type

Creating new `Teams Page` content type which will show all imported teams at once. 
I would like to display 2 tables, one for each Conference. I was not able to do this just in Views, I think I will need Panels or Display Suite.

TO DO! Continue here when data imported, add fields, display suite, etc.
